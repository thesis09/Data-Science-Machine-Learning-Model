**Air Quality and CO2 Emission Prediction Model**

*Overview*
This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning project aimed at predicting air quality and CO2 emissions. The project uses various datasets related to environmental factors, such as temperature, humidity, and industrial emissions, to predict air quality indices and CO2 emission levels. The goal is to provide an accurate and reliable tool that can help in environmental monitoring and decision-making processes.

**Introduction**
Air pollution and CO2 emissions are critical environmental issues that affect public health and contribute to climate change. This project focuses on building predictive models for air quality and CO2 emissions using machine learning techniques. The models can be used by policymakers, researchers, and environmental agencies to forecast pollution levels and take preventive measures.

**Data**
The dataset used in this project includes environmental factors such as:
-Temperature
-Humidity
-Wind speed
-Industrial emissions
-Traffic data
-Historical air quality indices
-Historical CO2 emission data
The data can be sourced from public environmental datasets or sensors placed in various locations.

**Installation**
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

git clone https://github.com/thesis09/air-quality-co2-prediction.git
cd air-quality-co2-prediction
